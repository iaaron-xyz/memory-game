## About the Game
- Every turn, you must choose 1 card among a group of them; you can choose anyone you like.
- Once you pick one, all the cards get shuffled, including the picked one.
- You must choose another card that is different from the previous one.
- Once a card is selected, the player can't select it again during the rest of the game.
- If you repeat a card, you lose.
